# Welcome to RealReview Project
A platform that helps newcomers discover honest reviews about properties and locations through user-submitted photos and ratings.
For this first version, I'll create a beautiful responsive application with a modern, minimal UI design. I'll implement a clean color scheme with gradients that convey trust and reliability.

## Features
- User Authentication (Signup/Login with Email, Google, etc.)
- Property Listings (Add, edit, and browse properties)
- Reviews & Ratings (Users can leave reviews with images)
- Favorites System (Save favorite properties)
- Advanced Search (Filter by location, price, ratings)
- Image Uploads (Supabase Storage integration)
